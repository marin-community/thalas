"""Build-phase context for executor step construction.

``ExecutorStep`` and ``StepSpec`` are meant to be built during an executor *build
phase*, not at module-import time. Building a step at import scope freezes the
importing environment's region-specific ``marin_prefix()`` into the pipeline,
which then trips the executor's cross-region guard when the run lands in a
different region.

:func:`executor_context` marks a build phase. Constructing a step outside one
warns once per step name (or raises when ``MARIN_EXECUTOR_STRICT`` is set).
Standard frozen-dataclass pickling and ``deepcopy`` bypass ``__post_init__``, so a
worker unpickling a step never trips the guard; only direct construction and
``dataclasses.replace`` do.
