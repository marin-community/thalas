"""
Each `ExecutorStep` produces an `output_path`.
We associate each `output_path` with:
- A status file (`output_path/.executor_status`) containing simple text: SUCCESS, FAILED, DEP_FAILED, or RUNNING
- A LOCK file (`output_path/.executor_status.lock`) for distributed locking

The LOCK file contains JSON with {worker_id, timestamp} and is refreshed periodically.
On GCS, we use generation-based conditional writes for atomicity.
